Each user component also contains a “More” button. By clicking it, more information about the specific user will be displayed.

## Specific User Page

This page is separated into two parts. The first part displays standard information about the user, provided from the user's GitHub page. The second part is represented by the repos component, containing recent public repositories of the user.
